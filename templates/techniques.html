                    <h4>Organisation:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The aim is to practice different passing options at a centre pass.</li>
                        <li>8 players - 4 attackers, 4 defenders in two-thirds of the court. Players position themselves in a standard centre pass formation. C passes to GA who has made a diagonal drive into the centre third. Meanwhile WA drives to the top of the shooting area to receive the next pass. WA then passes to the GS.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Coaching Points:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure passes are accurate and into the space, enabling the moving player to attack the ball.</li>
                        <li>Use arms to maximise speed on sprints.</li>
                        <li>Land in an upright and balanced position to receive all passes and for the WA – as close the circle edge as possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Progressions:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vary the starting positions of the attackers e.g. on the inside of the defender.</li>
                        <li>Increase the pressure from the defenders.</li>

                        <li>1 feeder outside the shooting circle, 1 shooter, 2 circle defenders. Shooter moves around the area whilst being shadowed by the 2 defenders who form a V shape around the shooter. The defender at the back of this shape co-ordinates the movement of the second defender who is at the front, this is known as having “eyes at the back”. The feeder passes the ball to the shooter which is intercepted by one of the defenders. </li>

                        <li>Angle your body so the shooter is forced to move in a certain direction, ready for you to make the interception.</li>

                        <li>Defender half covers the attacking player with their body slightly angled in order to see the person with the cones.</li>
                        <li>Keep head still and eyes up (you should be able to see the cones and attacking player at the same time without turning the head).</li>
                        <li>Use arms appropriately to increase speed.</li>
                    </ul>
